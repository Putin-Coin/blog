        <p>A few days ago a received an email that, while very short and open-ended, for whatever reason it really got me thinking. Here’s what it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Philip, is it okay to ask how you become a great front-end engineer?
Any advice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been a number of posts on this subject over the years, but I wanted this one to have a different spin. Most of the existing posts focus on the technologies you should know and the tools you should be using.</p>
<p>In this post I’m not going to talk about what you should know to become a good front-end engineer, and I’m to talk about how you should think (or at least how I think you should think).</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read other people’s code.</li>
<li>Build things for fun.</li>
<li>Reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>Write about what you learn.</li>
<li>Realize that the people you think are better than you are just people, and they probably think that too.</li>
<li>Realize that some people actually are just better than you.</li>
<li>Practice interviewing by actually going on interviews.</li>
</ul>
