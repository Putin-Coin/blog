href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/">CSS Custom Properties</a>—shipped in Chrome Canary behind the Experimental Web Platform Features flag.<sup><a href=#footnote-1>[1]</a></sup></p><p>When Chrome engineer <a href=https://twitter.com/addyosmani>Addy Osmani</a> first tweeted about the release, he was met with a surprising amount of <a href=https://twitter.com/joshlangner/status/661608288707026944>negativity</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/kuizinas/status/661600615911526401>hostility</a>, and <a href=https://twitter.com/DanTup/status/661609987047866368>skepticism</a>. At least, it was surprising to me, given how excited I am about this feature.</p><p>After a quick scan of the responses, it was clear that 99% of the complaints focused on these two things:</p><ul><li>The syntax is “ugly” and “verbose”.</li><li>Sass already has variables, so why should I care?</li></ul><p>While I admit I <em>do</em> get the dislike of the syntax, it’s important to understand it wasn’t just arbitrarily chosen. Members of the CSS working group discussed syntax at length, and they <a href=http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4KT0>had to pick something</a> that was compatible with the grammar of CSS and wouldn’t conflict with future additions to the language.</p><p>In regards to CSS variables vs. Sass variables, this is where I think the biggest misunderstanding lies:</p><p>Native CSS variables weren’t just an attempt to copy what CSS preprocessors could already do. In fact, if you read some of the <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=syntax+%22css-variables%22+site:lists.w3.org%2FArchives%2FPublic%2Fwww-style">initial design discussions</a>, you’ll see that most of the motivation for native CSS variables was to make it possible to do things you <em>can’t</em> do with preprocessors!</p><p>CSS preprocessors are fantastic tools, but their variables are static and lexically scoped. Native CSS variables, on the other hand, are an entirely different kind of variable: they’re dynamic, and they’re scoped to the DOM. In fact, I think it’s confusing to call them variables at all. They’re actually CSS properties, which gives them an entirely different set of capabilities and allows them to solve an entirely different set of problems.</p><p>In this article I’m going to discuss some of the things you can do with CSS custom properties that you can’t do with preprocessor variables. I’ll also demo some of the new design patterns that custom properties enable. Finally, I’ll discuss why I think in the future we’ll most likely use preprocessor variables and custom properties together, to leverage the best of both worlds.</p><div class=Callout><p><strong>Note:</strong> this article is <em>not</em> an introduction to CSS custom properties. If you’ve never heard of them or are unfamiliar with how they work, I’d recommend <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables>getting yourself acquainted</a> first.</p></div><h2 id=the-limitations-of-preprocessor-variables>The limitations of preprocessor variables</h2><p>Before continuing, I want to stress that I really do like CSS preprocessors, and I use them in all my projects. Preprocessors can do some pretty amazing things, and even if you know they ultimately just spit out raw CSS, they can still feel magical at times.</p><p>That being said, like any tool, they have their limitations, and sometimes the appearance of dynamic power can make those limitations surprising, especially to new users.</p><h3 id=preprocessor-variables-arent-live>Preprocessor variables aren’t live</h3><p>Perhaps the most common example of a preprocessor limitation that surprises newcomers is Sass’s inability to define variables or use <code>@extend</code> inside a media query. Since this article is about variables, I’ll focus on the former:</p><pre><code class=language-scss><span class=hljs-variable>$gutter</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1em</span>;

@<span class=hljs-keyword>media</span> (min-width: 30em) {
  <span class=hljs-variable>$gutter</span>: <span class=hljs-number>2em</span>;
}

<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Container</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>padding</span>: <span class=hljs-variable>$gutter</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>If you compile the above code, this is what you’ll get:</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-selector-class>.Container</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>padding</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1em</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the media query block simply gets discarded and the variable assignment ignored.</p><p>While it may be theoretically possible for Sass to make conditional variable declarations work, doing so would be challenging and require enumerating all permutations—exponentially increasing the final size of your CSS.</p><p>Since you can’t change a variable based on the matching <code>@media</code> rule, your only option is to assign a unique variable per media query, and code out each variation separately. More on this later.</p><h3 id=preprocessor-variables-dont-cascade>Preprocessor variables don’t cascade</h3><p>Whenever you use variables, the question of scope inevitably comes into play. Should this variable be global? Should it be scoped to the file/module? Should it be scoped to the block?</p><p>Since CSS is ultimately going to style HTML, it turns out there’s another useful way to scope variables: to a DOM element. But since preprocessors don’t run in the browser and never see the markup, they can’t do this.</p><p>Consider a site that tries to add the class <code>user-setting-large-text</code> to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element for users who’ve indicated their preference for larger text sizes. When this class is set, the larger <code>$font-size</code> variable assignment should apply:</p><pre><code class=language-scss><span class=hljs-variable>$font-size</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1em</span>;

<span class=hljs-selector-class>.user-setting-large-text</span> {
  <span class=hljs-variable>$font-size</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1.5em</span>;
}

<span class=hljs-selector-tag>body</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>font-size</span>: <span class=hljs-variable>$font-size</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>But again, just like with the media block example above, Sass ignores this variable assignment altogether, meaning this kind of thing isn’t possible. Here’s the output:</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-selector-tag>body</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>font-size</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1em</span>;
}
</code></pre><h3 id=preprocessor-variables-dont-inherit>Preprocessor variables don’t inherit</h3><p>Though inheritance is technically part of the cascade, I want to call it out separately because of how many times I’ve wanted to use this feature but couldn’t.</p><p>Consider a situation where you have DOM elements that you want to style based on whatever colors happen to be applied to their parent:</p><pre><code class=language-scss><span class=hljs-selector-class>.alert</span> { <span class=hljs-attribute>background-color</span>: lightyellow; }
<span class=hljs-selector-class>.alert</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.info</span> { <span class=hljs-attribute>background-color</span>: lightblue; }
<span class=hljs-selector-class>.alert</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.error</span> { <span class=hljs-attribute>background-color</span>: orangered; }

<span class=hljs-selector-class>.alert</span> <span class=hljs-selector-tag>button</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>border-color</span>: darken(background-color, <span class=hljs-number>25%</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>The above code isn’t valid Sass (or CSS), but you should be able to understand what it’s trying to accomplish.</p><p>The last declaration is trying to use Sass’s <code>darken</code> function on the <code>background-color</code> property that the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element could inherit from its parent <code>.alert</code> element. If the class <code>info</code> or <code>error</code> has been added to the alert (or if the background color has been arbitrarily set via JavaScript or a user style), the button element wants to be able to respond to that.</p><p>Now, obviously this won’t work in Sass because preprocessors don’t know about the DOM structure, but hopefully it’s clear why this type of thing could be useful.</p><p>To call out one particular use case: it would be extremely handy to be able to run color functions on inherited DOM properties for accessibility reasons. For example, to ensure text is always readable and sufficiently contrasts with the background color. With custom properties and new <a href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#modifying-colors>CSS color functions</a>, this will soon be possible!</p><h3 id=preprocessor-variables-arent-interoperable>Preprocessor variables aren’t interoperable</h3><p>This is a relatively obvious downside of preprocessors, but I mention it because I think it’s important. If you’re building a site with PostCSS and you want to use a third-party component that’s only themeable via Sass, you’re out of luck.</p><p>It’s not possible (or at least not easy) to share preprocessor variables across different toolsets or with third-party stylesheets hosted on a CDN.</p><p>Native CSS custom properties will work with any CSS preprocessor or plain CSS file. The reverse is not usually true.</p><h2 id=how-custom-properties-are-different>How custom properties are different</h2><p>As you’ve probably guessed, none of the limitations I listed above apply to CSS custom properties. But perhaps what’s more important than <em>that</em> they don’t apply is <em>why</em> they don’t apply.</p><p>CSS custom properties are just like regular CSS properties, and they operate in exactly the same way (with the obvious exception that they don’t style anything).</p><p>Like regular CSS properties, custom properties are dynamic. They can be modified at runtime, they can be updated inside a media query or by adding a new class to the DOM. They can be assigned inline (on an element) or in a regular CSS declaration with a selector. They can be updated or overridden using all the normal rules of the cascade or using JavaScript. And, perhaps most importantly, they’re inheritable, so when they’re applied to a DOM element, they get passed to that element’s children.</p><p>To put that more succinctly, preprocessor variables are lexically scoped and static after compilation. Custom properties are scoped to the DOM. They’re live, and they’re dynamic.</p><h2 id=real-life-examples>Real-life examples</h2><p>If you’re still not sure what custom properties can do that preprocessor variables can’t, I have some examples for you.</p><p>For what it’s worth, there were a ton of really great examples I wanted to show, but in the interest of not letting this article get too long, I settled on two.</p><p>I picked these examples because they’re not just theoretical, they’re actual challenges I’ve faced in the past. I can distinctly remember trying to make them work with preprocessors, but it just wasn’t possible. With custom properties, now it is.</p><h3 id=responsive-properties-with-media-queries>Responsive properties with media queries</h3><p>Many sites use a “gap” or “gutter” variable that defines the default spacing between items in the layout as well as the default padding for all the various sections on the page. Most of the time, you want the value of this gutter to be different depending on how big the browser window is. On large screens you want a lot of space between items (a lot of breathing room), but on smaller screens you can’t afford that much space, so the gutters need to be smaller.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Sass variables don’t work in media queries, so you have to code out each variation separately.</p><p>The following example defines the variables <code>$gutterSm</code>, <code>$gutterMd</code>, and <code>$gutterLg</code>, and then declares separate rules for each variation:</p><pre><code class=language-scss><span class=hljs-comment>/* Declares three gutter values, one for each breakpoint */</span>

<span class=hljs-variable>$gutterSm</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1em</span>;
<span class=hljs-variable>$gutterMd</span>: <span class=hljs-number>2em</span>;

On the one hand, it’s something most well-respected CSS developers warn against. But on the other hand, it’s something most people still do every day.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/csswizardry>Harry Roberts</a> recently wrote <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2015/06/contextual-styling-ui-components-nesting-and-implementation-detail/">this post</a> with his thoughts on the matter:</p><blockquote><p>If you need to change the cosmetics of a UI component based on where it is placed, your design system is failing…Things should be designed to be ignorant; things should be designed so that we always just have “this component” and not &quot;this component when inside…</p></blockquote><p>While I do side with Harry on this (and most things), I think the fact that so many people take shortcuts in these situations is perhaps indicative of a larger problem: that CSS is limited in its expressiveness, and most people aren’t satisfied with any of the current “best practices”.</p><p>The following example shows how most people approach contextual styling in CSS, using the descendant combinator:</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-comment>/* Regular button styles. */</span>
<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Button</span> { }

<span class=hljs-comment>/* Button styles that are different when inside the header. */</span>
<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Header</span> <span class=hljs-selector-class>.Button</span> { }
</code></pre><p>This approach has a lot of problems (which I explain in my article on <a href=/articles/css-architecture/#modifying-components-based-on-who-their-parents-are>CSS Architecture</a>). One way to recognize this pattern as a code smell is it violates the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle>open/closed principle</a> of software development; it modifies the implementation details of a closed component.</p><blockquote><p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p></blockquote><p>Custom properties change the paradigm of defining components in an interesting way. With custom properties, we can, for the first time, write components that are actually open for extension. Here’s an example:</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-selector-class>.Button</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>background</span>: <span class=hljs-built_in>var</span>(--Button-backgroundColor, <span class=hljs-number>#eee</span>);
  <span class=hljs-attribute>border</span>: <span class=hljs-number>1px</span> solid <span class=hljs-built_in>var</span>(--Button-borderColor, <span class=hljs-number>#333</span>);
  <span class=hljs-attribute>color</span>: <span class=hljs-built_in>var</span>(--Button-color, <span class=hljs-number>#333</span>);
  <span class=hljs-comment>/* ... */</span>
}

<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Header</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--Button-backgroundColor</span>: purple;
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--Button-borderColor</span>: transparent;
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--Button-color</span>: white;
}
</code></pre><p>The difference between this and the descendant combinator example is subtle but important.</p><p>When using descendant combinators we’re declaring that buttons inside the header <em>will look this way</em>, and that way is different from how the button component defines itself. Such a declaration is dictatorial (to borrow Harry’s word) and hard to undo in the case of an exception where a button in the header <em>doesn’t</em> need to look this way.</p><p>With custom properties, on the other hand, the button component is still ignorant of its context and completely decoupled from the header component. Its declaration simply says: <em>I’m going to style myself based on these custom properties, whatever they happen to be in my current situation</em>. And the header component simply says: <em>I’m going to set these property values; it’s up to my descendants to determine if and how to use them</em>.</p><p>The main difference is that the extension is opt-in by the button component, and it’s easily undone in the case of an exception.</p><p>The following demo illustrates contextual styling of both links and buttons in the header of a site as well as the content area.</p><figure><a href="http://codepen.io/philipwalton/pen/KdxmWL/?editors=110"><img srcset="

<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Button</span> { }

<span class=hljs-comment>/* Button styles that are different when inside the header. */</span>
<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Header</span> <span class=hljs-selector-class>.Button</span> { }

<span class=hljs-comment>/* Undo button styles in the header that are also in promo. */</span>
<span class=hljs-selector-class>.Header</span> <span class=hljs-selector-class>.Promo</span> <span class=hljs-selector-class>.Button</span> { }
</code></pre><p>With custom properties, you can simply update the button properties to be whatever you want, or reset them to return to the default styling. And regardless of the number of exceptions, the way to alter the styles is always the same.</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-selector-class>.Promo</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--Button-backgroundColor</span>: initial;
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--Button-borderColor</span>: initial;
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--Button-color</span>: initial;
}
</code></pre><h4 id=learning-from-react>Learning from React</h4><p>When I was first exploring the idea of contextual styling via custom properties, I was skeptical. Like I said, my inclination is to prefer context-agnostic components that define their own variations rather than adapting to arbitrary data inherited from their parent.</p><p>But one thing that helped sway my opinion was comparing custom properties in CSS to <code>props</code> in React.</p><p>React <code>props</code> are also dynamic, DOM-scoped variables, and they’re inheritable, which allows components to be context-dependent. In React, parent components pass data to child components, and then child components define what <code>props</code> they’re willing to accept and how they’re going to use them. This architectural model is commonly known as one-way data flow.</p><p>Even though custom properties are a new, untested domain, I think the success of the React model gives me confidence that a complex system can be built on top of property inheritance—and, moreover, that DOM-scoped variables are a useful design pattern.</p><h2 id=minimizing-side-effects>Minimizing side effects</h2><p>CSS custom properties all inherit by default. In some cases, this could lead to components being styled in ways they may not have intended.</p><p>As I showed in the previous section, you can prevent this by resetting individual properties, which prevents unknown values from being applied to an element’s children:</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-selector-class>.MyComponent</span> {
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--propertyName</span>: initial;
}
</code></pre><p>Though not part of the specification yet, the <code>--</code> property has been discussed,<sup>[<a href=#footnote-2>2</a>]</sup> which could be used to reset all custom properties. And if you wanted to whitelist just a few properties, you could set them individually to <code>inherit</code>, which would allow them to continue to operate normally:</p><pre><code class=language-css><span class=hljs-selector-class>.MyComponent</span> {
  <span class=hljs-comment>/* Resets all custom properties. */</span>
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--</span>: initial;

  <span class=hljs-comment>/* Whitelists these individual custom properties */</span>
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--someProperty</span>: inherit;
  <span class=hljs-attribute>--someOtherProperty</span>: inherit;
}
</code></pre><h3 id=managing-global-names>Managing global names</h3><p>If you’ve been paying attention to how I name my custom properties, you’ve probably noticed that I prefix components-specific properties with the class name of the component itself, e.g. <code>--Button-backgroundColor</code>.</p><p>Like most names in CSS, custom properties are global and there’s always the possibility that they’ll conflict with names being used by other developers on your team.</p><p>An easy way to avoid this problem is to stick to a naming convention, like I’ve done here.</p><p>For more complex projects, you’d probably want to consider something like <a href=https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules>CSS Modules</a> which localifies all global names and has recently <a href=https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-values/issues/6#issuecomment-155526613>expressed interest</a> in supporting custom properties.</p><h2 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping up</h2><p>If you weren’t familiar with custom properties in CSS before reading this article, I hope I’ve convinced you to give them a shot. And if you were one of the people skeptical of their necessity, I hope I’ve changed your mind.</p><p>Custom properties bring a new set of dynamic and powerful capabilities to CSS, and I’m sure many of their biggest strengths have yet to be discovered.</p><p>Custom properties fill a gap that preprocessor variables simply can’t. Despite that, preprocessor variables remain the easier-to-use and more elegant choice in many cases. Because of this, I firmly believe that many sites will use a combination of both in the future. Custom properties for dynamic theming and preprocessor variables for static templating.</p><p>I don’t think it has to be an either-or situation. And pitting them against each other as competitors does a disservice to everyone.</p><div class=Thanks><p>Special thanks to <a href=https://twitter.com/addyosmani>Addy Osmani</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/gauntface>Matt Gaunt</a> for reviewing this article and to Shane Stephens for prioritizing and fixing a Chrome bug to get the demos working.</p></div><aside class=Footnotes><h1 class=Footnotes-title>Footnotes:</h1><ol class=Footnotes-items><li id=footnote-1>You can enable the Experimental Web Platform Features flag in Chrome by navigating to the address <code>about:flags</code>, searching for "Experimental Web Platform Features", and clicking the "enable" button.</li><li id=footnote-2>Use of the <code>--</code> property (as it relates to styling custom elements) was mentioned by Tab Atkins in this <a href=https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/300#issuecomment-144551648>Github comment</a>.
